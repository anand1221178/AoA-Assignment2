BST Experiments - Comparing Four Shuffling Methods
===================================================
1. No Shuffle (Sequential) - Worst Case O(n) height
2. Fisher-Yates (Classic) - Random Case O(log n) height
3. RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE (CLRS) - Random Case O(log n) height
4. PERMUTE-BY-SORTING (CLRS) - Random Case O(log n) height

Size range: 100 to 50000
Sequential trees limited to 10000 nodes (stack safety)
Number of size points: 18

Estimated runtime: 2-10 minutes depending on CPU
Progress will be shown below...
